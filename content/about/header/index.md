I am currently a state epidemiologist with experience in public health surveillance, infectious disease, and survey analysis. I am a former healthcare analyst with multiple years of experience with claims and healthcare data. In addition, I have experience with many aspects of data science, including NLP/text mining, markdown reports, R Shiny applications, social network analysis, regression, geospatial mapping and analysis, and machine learning.

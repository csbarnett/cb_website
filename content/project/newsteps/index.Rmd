# Summary
[NewSTEPs](https://www.newsteps.org/index.php/) is a national newborn screening resource center funding by the [Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL)](https://www.aphl.org/Pages/default.aspx) designed to provide data, technical assistance and training to newborn screening programs and assist states with quality improvement initiatives.

In Auguest of 2022, I presented at the APHL NewSTEPs CQI National Meeting, which was convened in-person (Washington D.C) and virtually with newborn screening professionals and stakeholders across state and territorial newborn screening programs. The goal of this conference is to collaborate on ways to improve and transform newborn screening systems in the U.S.

My presentation focused on the numerous improvements our program had made in understanding critical congenital heart defects (CCHDs) in Alaska.

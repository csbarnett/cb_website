title: "Critical Congenital Heart Disease, Prevalence, and Detection"
subtitle: "Alaska, 2007â€“2018"
excerpt: "Critical congenital heart defects (CCHDs) are a subgroup of 12 heart defects that require intervention within the first year of life to prevent permanent disability or death. The U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 7,200 infants are born with a CCHD nationally each year. Early detection of CCHDs by prenatal ultrasound, clinical assessment, and pulse oximetry screening performed at 24 hours of life can improve prognosis. This Bulletin characterizes the prevalence of CCHDs in Alaska as well as the methods and timing of clinical detection."

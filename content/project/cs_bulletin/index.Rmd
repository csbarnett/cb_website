title: "Congenital Syphilis in Alaska"
subtitle: "A Troublesome Trend"
excerpt:  "Congenital syphilis occurs when a syphilis infection is untreated in an expecting mother and their unborn child. Congenital syphilis is preventable, but if left untreated, it can cause numerous adverse health outcomes or even death of the fetus. In June of 2023, my colleagues and I at the State of Alaska Division of Public Health published a white paper (*Bulletin*) describing the increase in congenital syphilis cases in Alaska in the previous five years."

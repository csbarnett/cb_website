# Introduction

The best resource for the purrr package is likely the [Iteration chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#the-map-functions) in R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. Hadley Wickham is one of the authors of the purrr package and he spends a good deal of the chapter clearly explaining how it works. It is definitely recommended further reading. And for those of us in public health there is also a chapter on purrr in [R for Epidemiology](https://www.r4epi.com/using-the-purrr-package.html).

The purpose of this markdown document is to provide a short introduction to purrr, focusing on just a handful of functions.

## What is the purrr package used for?
Answer: The process of looping over a vector, applying a function or change to each element, and saving the results is common in R programming. The purrr package provide tools accomplish this that are more succinct and easier to read.

## Can I just use base R?
Answer: Yes. All of this is absolutely possible with base R, using for() loops or the “apply” functions, such as lapply(), and by()

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,comment=NA,message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(purrr)
```



```{r warning=FALSE}

# Creating a list of character objects (public health regions)
public_health_regions <- list("Anchorage", "Mat-Su", "Interior", "Northern", "Southeast", "Southwest", "Gulf Coast")

# Detecting the string pattern "South" in list with lapply fuction
lapply(public_health_regions,
       function(x){str_detect(string = x, pattern = "South")}
       )


# Detecting the string pattern "South" in list with purrr:::map fuction
map(public_health_regions,
       function(x){str_detect(string = x, pattern = "South")}
       )
```
The code and output of the map() and lapply functions are nearly identical. However, the purrr package comes with a more well defined and **consistent** syntax and a ease of use over base R looping functions. The user interface of the “apply”" functions is not as consistent and all previous looping functions pre-date the pipe %>% operator. 


## What else can the purrr package do?
In addition, the purrr package includes a host of useful functions for looping over vectors and list. The [purrr cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/purrr.pdf) is particully helpful.
```{r}
# Filtering on list items that contain the string pattern "South"
# Keep() function selects list items that pass a logical test
keep(public_health_regions,
       function(x){str_detect(string = x, pattern = "South")}
       )

# Pluck a single element from a vector or environment 
pluck(.x = public_health_regions, 1)
```


```{r}

# Creating a function that converts string object "Mat-Su" 
# to "Matanuska-Susitna"
matsu <- function(x){
  ifelse(x == "Mat-Su", "Matanuska-Susitna", x)
}

# Modifying an element within a list without removing it from the list
modify(.x = public_health_regions, .f = matsu)
```
## The purrr package works seemlessly with piping operators

```{r warning=FALSE}
head(mtcars, 4)


# How does the number of cylinders change the relationship between
# car miles per gallon and car weight?
mtcars %>%
  split(.$cyl) %>% # Spliting mtcars into 3 cyl dataframes 
  map(~ lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .)) %>% # fitting a linear model on all 3 dataframes
  map(summary) %>% # Obtaining model summaries on all 3 models
  map_dbl("r.squared")

```
